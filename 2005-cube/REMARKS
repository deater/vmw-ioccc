ABUSE OF RULES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  + The executable needs to read in its own source code in order to run.
    As long as the source is in the same directory as the executable
    it should be able to find it...
  + The program requires the OpenGL library.
  + The program abuses severely the whitespace and { } ; exceptions
    in the filesize limits.

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  + OpenGL (Mesa will work, although slowly)
  + 16bpp graphics capability
  + The original source needs to be in the same directory as the
    executable, and the source's name should be the same as the
    executable but with .c on the end.

Background:
~~~~~~~~~~~
  I was annoyed after the last IOCC because I slaved away on a clever text 
  based game only to find all of the game winners used X11!
  
  X11 isn't standard C!

  So to one up them, I decided to use OpenGL.  
  
  OpenGL is standard, and most modern Unix-like systems have either 
  accelerated graphics or software rendering.

Obfuscation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  It was a challenge getting the source code below the 2k limit.
  OpenGL has way too many GRATUITOUSLY_LONG_CONSTANTS and
  glLongStudlyFunctionNames();

  Therefore, much of the obfuscation comes secondary to just reducing the code
  size to fit under the limit  while still having some semblance of a demo.  
  
  There are some interesting abuses scattered about.

Usage:
~~~~~~
  Try hitting the spacebar when the program is running.

For Fun:
~~~~~~~~
  Try modifying the texture to your own custom design...

  Many thanks to John Clemens for testing this on various machines for me.
