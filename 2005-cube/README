"cube.c", winner of "Most Beauteous Visuals" in the 2005 IOCCC
            by Vince Weaver (vince _at_ deater.net)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code should be self-documenting.

For spoilers see the "REMARKS" file.

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Some sort of OpenGL implementation.  It works (slowly) with Mesa.
  
  Tested under Linux ( amd64, x86, big-endian PPC),
     MacOSX (10.4.x) and on SGI Irix 6.5 (r10k). 

  The source code needs to be in the same directory as the compiled 
     binary in order to run.

To compile:
~~~~~~~~~~~

 gcc -O2 -o cube -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLU -lX11 cube.c
  
  On AMD64 machines (and possibly other 64-bit Linuxes) you might
    have to do:
    
 gcc -O2 -o cube -L/usr/X11R6/lib64 -lGL -lGLU -lX11 cube.c


To run:
~~~~~~~

  Just type "./cube"
   
  On OSX you will have to start the X11 X-server first or else
    you'll get errors.

To use:
~~~~~~~
  "spacebar" to change the scene a bit
  ESCAPE should quit.  If that fails, try backslash.

To print:
~~~~~~~~~
  enscript -fCourier7 -E -o cube.ps cube.c


To partly un-obfuscate:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  sed -e '/^#.*include/d' cube.c | cpp | indent
  

Errors you can get:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  0 = no error
  1 = X problem
  2 = Can't open glx
  3 = Can't open 16bpp visual
  4 = can't open source file

Changes:
~~~~~~~~

   After submission, I made some minor changes to remove recursive CPP macros
     (which I had accidentally included) and also made a fix to allow the
     program to compile and run under Irix 6.5.22 (CWBorderPixel added
     to XCreateWindow() ).
     
   The code formatting was then re-arranged to preserve the original layout.
     
   The original submission is included here as "cube.c.orig".
